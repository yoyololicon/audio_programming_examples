# Python implementations of examples from "The Audio Programming Book"

Re-implement some of the example codes from the book [The Audio Programming Book](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/audio-programming-book).
Still work in progress. Currently finished [chapter 9](ch9) and [8](ch8).

## Notes

* These are not line-by-line implementations. Most of the cases are just replacing for loop with numpy magical functions. 
I will try my best not to use too fancy module (like librosa.stft).
* Will not cover all the examples. I only do what I think interesting or can be benefit to my research.

I know using python instead of c/c++ is somehow like cheating but, whatever.
